# eurorack-1A-10pin-supply
This is a simple eurorack supply with too many busses. It is 1A on both + and - sides. 
You have to use a double main to 12V transformer. 
All components are in the schematic. The top layers in pcb design are there to symbolyze bridges. With that out of the way, the pcb is onesided.
The pcb looks bad- I know.
