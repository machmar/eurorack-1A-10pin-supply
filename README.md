# eurorack-1A-10pin-supply
This is a eurorack PSU which uses two 3A PWM regulators like [these from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004052885353.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.695838edDr9Fcs&algo_pvid=d174f836-2c64-4925-bf83-09754ddc93be&algo_exp_id=d174f836-2c64-4925-bf83-09754ddc93be-3&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2212000027872810881%22%7D&pdp_npi=2%40dis%21CZK%21%2119.72%21%21%21%21%21%400b0a555916520957518301529e174a%2112000027872810881%21sea) and outputs +-12V DC.  
The output is only a 10 pin power bus.  
As the power source, use a AC transformer with two 12V or 15V secondary windings.

As for the old files in this repo (1A PSU). I've disgned them over 4 years ago and back then I had no idea how to make good PCBs (not saying this new PCB is something amazing). I feel bad deleting them so I'll leave them here but **DO NOT BUILD THE OLD FILES!**.
